## A full python CI/CD workflow

## :briefcase: Project Status 
#### Currently work in progress :hammer_and_wrench:

## :pushpin: Introduction

This repo has been created in order to illustrate the complete process of building, packaging and deploying a python project. I will try to show the different CI/CD stages that a project built from scratch goes through before deploying it into production. In this case, I will implement a basic library that will be deployed in Pypi through Azure Pipeline, publishing coverage and test metrics, documentation in readthedocs, etc.


## :fire: Motivation

The idea is to establish a How-To for my future projects and compile the whole process in my Medium where I will try to publish works often. Of course I'm always open to suggestions from the community! So feel free to propose more stages or ideas.
